libxfce4ui (4.8.0-4) unstable; urgency=low
 
  Starting Gtk+ 2.24.7, the Control key often found on PC keyboards isn't
  called 'Control' but 'Primary', breaking configured keyboard shortcuts
  already set. If you experience this in Xfce (application not starting and
  keyboard shortcut using Control key), just re-bind the various
  shortcuts using the same keys combination. The shortcut will be replaced by
  the 'Primary' version and will work correctly.
